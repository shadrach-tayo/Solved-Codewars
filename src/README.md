# Solved Codewars

 this is a repository to keep track of some of the codewars kata i solve in my leisure time as part of a growth challenge i set for myself.

## To get started
- fork and clone the repository
- enter index.js to view codewars
- check kataInfo.js for information on any kata in index.js
- [unsubmitted-kata.js](./Unsubmitted-kata.js) contains codewars kata yet to be completed or completed and yet to be submited

### Todo:
1. create a test folder to write test for each kata
2. create different files for all codewars kata
